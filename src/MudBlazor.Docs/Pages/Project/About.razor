        <MudText Typo="Typo.h4" GutterBottom="true">How it started</MudText>
        <MudText>I had a vision for this project, to keep it clean and simple with a modern design that is highly customizable. Simple and easy to use components. More CSS, SASS and no Javascript or at least just the absolutely necessary if there is something Blazor and CSS cannot do.</MudText>
        <MudText Class="mt-4">I've been developing .NET Core websites and working specifically with Blazor since late 2018. Since then I have seen amazing Blazor library projects but I feel most of them are over-engineered and some of them "ports" with massive amounts of Javascript to keep the frontend running. Which of course doesn't mean it's bad, but i feel it contradicts what Blazor is all about.</MudText>

        <MudText Typo="Typo.h4" GutterBottom="true" Class="mt-8">I was not alone</MudText>
        <MudText>I was almost about to give up, the time it took to make everything my self, the knowledge i lacked made it hard and the project was at the time not public and far from it. I started looking around, there must be another library out there i could contribute to instead with the same vision and values.</MudText>
        <MudText>And there is how it all started for real, in a random gitter chat i was talking in one of the users message me and we start talking. I notice he is intrested and we both have the same vision. I make a promise to clean up my library and prepare it to go public on Github.</MudText>

        <MudText Typo="Typo.h4" GutterBottom="true" Class="mt-8">Our Story</MudText>
        <MudText>From this point on we work hard to get something ready for what we call "first release" day and night, we cover eatchothers shortcommings and something great is comming along.</MudText>
        <MudText>And tts no longer a one person show, now its our vision and our values.</MudText>
